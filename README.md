## Introduction

A minimal golden file testing library for Rust,
when golden files are required for external api requests.

## Warning & Disclaimer

Currently intended for _personal use_, and has the following limitations:

- Be aware that the design is very messy and not scalable.
- This is just the initial published version, and the API is not stable.

## Documentation

For detailed documentation, check [crates.io](https://docs.rs/goldrust/latest/goldrust/)

## Todo

- Update documentation to match the current commit.
- Implement common traits for public structs.
